# Alaska's Economy

I recently visited Alaska for the first time, and it's seriously God's country. To get more involved in it's affairs, this is a public repository for all my research going into Alaska's economy, which will be used to make a software solution for its residence or tourists. Furthermore, for the sake of sharing ideas with each other, this repo is open source.

## Repo Structure

The `/Research` folder is the meat and potatoes of this repository. It contains many PDF reports generated by Deep Research tools. This is research directed by humans and automatically carried out by machine, representing the equivalent of thousands of hours worth of work.

This material is to be used as research tools in making a solution in the tech space, but this repository is extremely valuable in its own right. Feel free to copy the PDFs into NotebookLM or other tools of your choice to discuss.

## Participation

- Copy the PDFs to NotebookLM to rapidly interrogate the model
- Open an `Issue` here on GitHub if you spot anything glaringly wrong or obviously missing
- Start a `Discussion` here on GitHub to discuss the PLE framework
- Anything off-topic will be deleted and result in an irrevocable ban

The purpose of this repo is to share my research in an open source manner and solicit meaningful, on-topic feedback.
